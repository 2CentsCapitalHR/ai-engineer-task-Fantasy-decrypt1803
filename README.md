# ADGM Corporate Agent â€“ Document Intelligence Prototype

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The **ADGM Corporate Agent** is an AI-powered legal assistant that reviews, validates, and checks the completeness of legal documents for **Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)** processes, such as company incorporation.

It:
- Accepts `.docx` files
- Detects document type (e.g., Articles of Association, Memorandum of Association)
- Verifies if all mandatory documents for a process are present
- Flags compliance issues ("red flags")
- Adds contextual review comments to `.docx`
- Generates a structured JSON report
- Uses **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with official ADGM documents for accuracy

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Multiple Document Upload**: Upload several `.docx` files at once
- **Process Detection**: Automatically infers the legal process (e.g., incorporation)
- **Checklist Verification**: Compares uploaded docs to ADGMâ€™s official required documents
- **Red Flag Detection**:
  - Missing jurisdiction clause
  - Incorrect jurisdiction (UAE Federal Courts instead of ADGM)
  - Missing signature section
  - Ambiguous/non-binding clauses
- **Inline Comments**: Adds red italicized review notes to `.docx` files
- **Structured Output**: JSON report with issues, severities, and suggestions
- **RAG Support**: Pulls ADGM guidance text from official references
